# Project Outline

## Phase 1 - Prototyping
- Figure out GUI design via prototyping/wireframe tool
  - Decided on proto.io.
  - Initial prototype almost complete.
- Decide on frameworks
  - React Native for Web & Mobile potential
  - Base UI framework - Ionic possibly?
    - Do initial Ionic configuration
    - Look for alternatives.

## Phase 2 - Base implementation
- Build React app with basic features and placeholder assets (if need be)
- Finalize functionality
- Tests for components

## Phase 3 - Feature-rich
- Add finishing touches (nicer UI elements, route map configuration?)

## Phase 4 - Release
- Figure out any changes, specifications for Android.
- Contact Dead Cells devs about asset usage.
- Figure out release for Google Play
- (maybe) figure out release to Apple (no way to personally test iOS devices though...)

# Expected Features
- Unlock tracking (boss cells, mutations, weapons)
- Stats
  - calculations for weapon and mutations performance
  - possibly room and/or route performance
  - enemy death calculations
- Route map
  - Interactive?
  - Maybe just small version and link to wiki?
- Run stats input
  - Last room, killed by, weapon configuration
